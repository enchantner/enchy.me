Hi everybody and welcome to my new blog!

I finally created MVP for this little thing using Pelican and hope to improve my writing skills 
as well as English.

I'll still post some things in Russian, probably, but plans are to use English as much as 
possible (or just create versions in two languages for some posts).
Besides, please don't hesitate to point at any stupid mistakes I will most likely do.

Main topics will be programming (mostly Python), life, tips and tricks and some other usual 
stories you may find in lots of other blogs. Doesn't look pretty interesting, but let's at least 
try. Thanks for reading!
